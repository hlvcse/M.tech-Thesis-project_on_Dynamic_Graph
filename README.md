We have developed a new algorithm for sparsifying graphs deterministically in order
to maintain dynamic fractional matchings. Dynamic fractional matchings are an
important component of the well-known problem of preserving maximum matching on
dynamic graphs under edge updates. Before our work, there existed two common rounding
methods for dynamic fractional matching that have been applied to various scenarios,
both of which were randomized: one by Arar et al. and another by David Wajc in the
years 2018 and 2020 respectively.

However, in 2021, Shayan Bhattacharya and Peter Kiss introduced the first deterministic
graph sparsification algorithm called "degree_split_subroutine()", which inspired us
to develop our own deterministic algorithm. The primary objective of our algorithm is
to produce a sparser graph without reducing the size of fractional matching. It is worth
noting that before 2021, all existing algorithms for preserving maximum matching on
dynamic graphs under edge updates were randomized.
